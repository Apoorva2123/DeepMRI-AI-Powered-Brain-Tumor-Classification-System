# DeepMRI: AI-Powered Brain Tumor Classification System

DeepMRI is an AI-driven project focused on classifying brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to build an accurate and reliable model that can assist in early detection and diagnosis, helping medical professionals make faster and more informed decisions. The system is designed with simplicity, performance, and real-world healthcare impact in mind.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

### Why this dataset?
- It contains real MRI brain scan images categorized into different tumor classes.
- The dataset is well-structured and commonly used for medical imaging research.
- It provides enough samples to train and evaluate deep learning models effectively.
- Using a public dataset ensures transparency and reproducibility of results.

## Goal of the Project

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Accurately classify brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories (or multiple tumor classes).
- Compare different deep learning models and identify the best-performing approach.
- Gain hands-on experience with medical image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
